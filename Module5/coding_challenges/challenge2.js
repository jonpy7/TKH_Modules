// Challenge 2:
// Create a for loop that logs the numbers 4 to 156 to the console. To log a value to the console
// use the console.log( ) method. However you should be skipping every 4 numbers, so you
// would be logging 4, 8, 12, 16, etc, etc

//Codepen: https://codepen.io/jperalta7/pen/poygEVK

for (i=4; i<=156; i=i+4) {
  console.log(i);
}
